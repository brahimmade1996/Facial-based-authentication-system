\section{Face alignment}
Facial alignment is a normalization technique often used to improve accuracy of face recognition algorithms which include deep learning methods that we used. The goal of a face alignment algorithm is to transform a dataset with face images so that each face should be centered in the image, rotated such that the eyes lie on a horizontal line and be scaled to a fixed size.
The process of face alignment is structured in two steps: the first one represents the detection of facial landmarks on the input image and the second one is the appliance of an affine transformation so that in the output image, the detected facial landmarks are at the same position every time.
