\chapter{Preliminaries}

In this chapter we present most of the notions used in this thesis. It is structured on four parts:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Face detection} - this part presents the approach used to identify multiple faces in an image
	\item \textbf{Face alignment} - here we cover the algorithm for alignment of specific landmarks of the face to a fixed position in the image
	\item \textbf{Face recognition} - this section introduces the neural network used to compute the feature vector from a face that is later used to determine the identify of the face
	\item \textbf{Face validation} - finally, we present the Local Binary Pattern feature descriptor and it's use in face validation
\end{itemize}
