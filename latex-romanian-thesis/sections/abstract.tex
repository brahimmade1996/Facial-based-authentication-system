Face recognition has been, in the last couple of years, the subject of extensive research given the advances in deep learning field of machine learning and given the growth in size of labeled data needed for these deep learning methods to provide state of the art results. In the project that this paper will further describe, we employed such a deep learning architecture in order to create an facial-based authentication system which we tried to make more robust adding a component for face spoof validation given it's security applications.
